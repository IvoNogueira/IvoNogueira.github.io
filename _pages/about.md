My name is Ivo Nogueira and I'm a Data Analyst at Farfetch.

I've been practicing Data Science for the last six years, not only professionally but also recreationally namely by creating pieces of software that serve little to no purpose other than my amusement. Feel free to check my project section where I have some examples of projects I have made for the past years.

I am very curious and I'm constantly learning and studying new topics that could be useful in my professional life. Currently, I am studying for my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, at the University of Minho, while also making an effort to keep informed about the latest trends in machine learning, namely by taking online courses.
